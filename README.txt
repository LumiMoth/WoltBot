This is a calculator for enemy generics stats, built around FE6 but still works with 7 and 8 (and has 8's new enemy classes built in).


After choosing a class, choose what level the enemy is and how many HMBs they get (see below for further details), as well as the third roll:
 - Double HMB is applied to all enemies during FE6's first 5 chapters, excluding reinforcements. No promoted enemies exist at this time, so there's no need to worry about that extra roll as well
 - The two promotion bonus options are applied to promoted classes, with the option of "FE7/8 NM" and "FE6 NM/HM". The first bonus is only applied if the player is playing FE7 or FE8 on a non-hard mode (Easy/Normal 8, Lyn, Eliwood, Hector Normal Mode). On 7 and 8's hard mode, and both FE6 modes, instead apply the second bonus.


In order to know how many HMBs to apply, follow the below charts:

FE6
Chapters 1 and 2	4
Chapters 3 and 4	5
Chapters 5 and 6	6
Chapters 7 to 8x	7
Chapters 9 and 10	8
Chapters 11 to 12x	9
Chapters 13 to 14x	10
Chapters 15 to 16x	11
Chapters 17 and 18	12
Chapters 19 to 20x	13
Chapters 21 and 22	14
Chapters 23 and 24	15
Final	                16

Alternatively, Round Up(CHAPTER NUMBER / 2) + 3 is a general equation for HMBs. Treat gaiden chapters as just their number without the x.

FE7
Only on Hector Hard Mode, apply 5 HMBs to all units.

FE8
Chapters P-1 : 1
Chapters 2-3 : 4
Chapters 4-14 + Eirika 15 : 5
Chapters 16 + Ephraim 15-F : 6
Additionally, FE8 promoted enemies might not get promoted autolevels in international release. I have not confirmed this (but it would explain a lot).



Additionally, 4 classes are appended at the end.
Female Nomad appears in FE7 Dread Isle
Female General appears in FE7 Cog of Destiny (NON-HHM)
Female Druid appears in FE7 Cog of Destiny (HHM)
Ranger/FE7 Nomad Trooper has 5 more res growth. This is largely, of course, inconsequential, but still added for good measure
